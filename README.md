# ATTENTION! UPDATE SKYRIM!

In order to install this modlist, you **MUST** have your copy of _Skyrim Special Edition_ **COMPLETELY UPGRADED** to the latest version before beginning. It must also be set to the **ENGLISH LANGUAGE,** no other version will function properly. _Wabbajack_ will automatically "downgrade" it and place a copy in the `Stock Game` folder for use during play. 

# Description

**This Modlist contains mods with sexual content and you need to be of legal age in your country, (most western countries: 18+, some eastern ones: 21+)**.
**I'm not your Mom and I will not provide any SFW versions of this List the degeneracy is the point**

Welcome to **TGT - Trash Goblins of Tamriel** This is a Mod list designed for Trash Computer and Lovers of the Trashy Girls, Punks, Goth's, any alt styles, preferable with Dark Eyeshadow. I will be updating the list to match with my tastes and updating the Clothing and style of the list as such.

Since my computer is Trash do not expect an ENB, 8k Textures or heavy Scripts or graphics. I have downgraded everything to 2k that I can.

All game systems are kinda up in the air right now and I flesh them out, I plan on having a good core or animatations both Fighting and Sexual, Combat will probably be pretty simple.

Sex Mods is going to be based off SexLab and with a modified Submissive Lola setup, I'm planning on supporting Males and Females but I think you are going to miss a bunch of content if you play as a Male.

I plan on having a bunch of quests and followers.

Combat, Magic, etc are all up in the air currently.

### System Specs

This is what I have

- CPU: >= Ryzen 3600
- GPU: >= GTX 970
- RAM: >= DDR4 with 36GB 3200
- HD:  >= M.2 2TB and a 10GB Spinning Rust for Storage

This is a low end system for Skyrim, the GPU will not handle ENB's or High Res Textures. I plan on updating my system eventually but for now this 

# Installation

##  Pre-Installation

These steps are only needed if you install this Modlist for the first time. If you update the Modlist, jump straight to **Updating**  in the **Troubleshooting** section.

###  Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

I doubt you need to do this since you likely already have this installed. The package is required for MO2 and you can download it from Microsoft. Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe">Direct link</a> if you can't find it.

###  Steam Config

**Change Steam's Update Behavior**

SSE is still being updated by Bethesda (they only add Creation Club content). Whenever the game updates, the entire modding community goes silent for the next one or two weeks because some mods need to be updated to the latest game runtime version.

To ensure that Steam does not automatically update the game for you and lock you out of playing your _Wabbajack_ modlist(s), head over to the Properties window, navigate to the Updates tab and change Automatic updates to _Only update this game when I launch it_. You should also disable the _Steam Cloud_ while you're at it.

**Set the Game language to English**

Wabbajack will check your game files and make sure that we have the same version. This also means that any other language than English will fail the installation.

Open the Steam Properties window, navigate to the Language tab and select English from the dropdown menu.

**Install Skyrim** (OPTIONAL)

If Skyrim is not installed, do so. _DO NOT_ install it _ANYWHERE_ inside a _Program Files_ folder. This will only wreak havoc in the end. 

If you must, create a Steam library elsewhere on your computer (for example, _D:\Steam_) and install Skyrim there. (Options for such are given within Steam.)

If you only have one hard drive and Steam is installed to _C:\Program Files_, you will have to relocate it to _C:\_.

**Clean Skyrim**

I highly recommend uninstalling the game through Steam, deleting the game folder and reinstalling it. **Do not install Skyrim anywhere inside any Program Files folder. Wabbajack will not work in a folder that is protected by Windows.** You should also clean up the Skyrim Special Edition folder in Documents/My Games/. 

**Start Skyrim**

After you have done everything above and have a clean SSE installation ready, start the Launcher and open the Options menu.

    Click on High
    Set the Aspect Ratio and Resolution to your monitor's native values
    Set Antialiasing to Whatever you want I used TAA
    Check Windowed Mode and Borderless if not checked

Start the game and exit once you're in the main menu.

##  Using Wabbajack

##  Downloading and Installing

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at the start of the installation. 

    Adjust the Installation Location to a directory located on the root directory of one of your drives
    For example, this might be "C:\TGT", "D:\TGT", or "E:\TGT"
    Ensure the Download Location is within that directory
    Click the Go/Begin button
    Wait for Wabbajack to finish

## Post-Installation

This setup was configured for a low end PC, thus I did not add an ENB or Reshade, if you wish to add your own you must add them to the _Stock Game Folder_

## Preparing the Game

The next step is to prepare the game for play. Navigate to the directory where you installed the modlist _TGT_. Inside you will notice an executable file called _ModOrganizer.exe_. This file (the _Mod Organizer 2_ application) has already been automatically installed and configured by Wabbajack with all the necessary mods to run the modlist and does not need to be updated, replaced, or manually configured. Simply launch it to continue.

## Crafting the Female Bodies

With the introduction of _OBody_ to the modlist, building BodySlides is basically a thing of the past. To use your preferred BodySlide preset with _TGT_, simply install and enable it anywhere in the list, complete character creation and MCM configuration, and strike the O key (the letter, not the number). This will bring up a list of every BodySlide preset you have installed. Choose the one you want, set your character's Weight via the Vanity Mirror, and you are good to go. You can switch the body as easily as you do your outfit. You can do the same with any NPC, by hovering the crosshair over them and striking the O key.

I will not support custom armors in my list at least currently.

# Launching the Game

Launch the game Using the _Launch Game (SKSE)_ in Mod Organizer. I'm experimenting with MCM Automation so there is nothing put together for this currently.

## Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the _TGT_ folder and be done with it.
